It's been one of my biggest investments, but it's been solid since day one. I call it Tesseract because its shape reminds me of the Tesseract from the MCU (yes, I\u2019m a big fan). Fun fact: back in university (around 2014), I had a portable HDD that I also named Tesseract. So, this feels like a full-circle moment for me.</p> <p>My main goal for Tesseract is to serve as a media server, which is why I chose the Asustor 5404T\u2014for its internal GPU that supports hardware-accelerated transcoding.
