Portainer is a container management tool, but I still prefer using Docker Compose for deploying containers whenever possible. I mainly use Portainer to get an overview of all my Docker containers in one dashboard and to perform simple tasks like checking status, viewing logs, or restarting containers.

For installations that donâ€™t provide a Docker Compose file, tools like Composerize can help. It converts the provided docker run commands into Docker Compose format for easier management.

``` py title="docker-compose.yaml"
services:
    portainer-ce:
        container_name: portainer
        image: portainer/portainer-ce:latest
        ports:
            - 8000:8000
            - 9443:9443
        volumes:
            - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
            - /opt/portainer/data:/data # please change /opt/portainer/data to your own directory
        restart: always
```
