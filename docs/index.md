# About me

Hey there! I’m **Arden**, a Network Engineer by day, currently working as a Backbone Network Engineer for a Japanese e-commerce company. I have a hobby of working on Homelab projects, which allows me to explore tech that I don’t get to play with at work and expand my skills beyond networking.

This is my first attempt at documenting everything I’ve been working on—mostly for my own memory (I tend to forget things pretty quickly!). But feel free to check it out and use it too!
